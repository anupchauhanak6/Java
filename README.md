# ðŸŒŸ My Java Learning Journey

Welcome! I am a student learning Java, and this repository is dedicated to documenting my progress, experiments, and insights as I explore the world of Java programming.

## About Me

- **Name:** Anup Chauhan
- **Background:** A brief description of your background and why you're interested in learning Java.
- **Learning Goals:** What do you hope to achieve? (e.g., mastering object-oriented programming, understanding Java basics, building small projects)

## Learning Objectives

Outline the topics you plan to cover. For example:
- **Fundamentals:** Variables, data types, operators, control flow (loops, conditionals).
- **Object-Oriented Programming:** Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism.
- **Core Java Concepts:** Exception handling, collections, generics, streams.
